## 3. Local Setup (Getting Started)

To start coding, follow these steps to set up your development environment.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python (version 3.9+)** and **`pip`** installed.

### 1. Fork and Clone

1.  **Fork** the main repository on GitHub.
2.  Clone your local copy:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[YOUR_USERNAME]/[PROJECT_NAME].git
    cd [PROJECT_NAME]
    ```

### 2. Configure the Virtual Environment

We highly recommend using a virtual environment (`venv`) to isolate project dependencies:

```bash
# Create and activate the virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows Powershell

# Install Flask and other library dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
